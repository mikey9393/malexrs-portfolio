        Welcome to my first website. I'm just finishing up my last semester at
        the College of Sourthern Idaho. At the end I will have recieved
        Associate degree. The road doesnt end there, I look forward to further
        devolope my capabillities and perhaps contribute knowledge of my own.
        Much of what I have learned over the last two years, I've applied to
        this website. Feel free to look around!
